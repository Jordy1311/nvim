# nvim

This is my own Neovim config.

Inspired by [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org) but stripped down to only the things I need.

## To install

```console
git clone https://github.com/Jordy1311/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim && nvim
```

## To uninstall

```console
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/state/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim
```
